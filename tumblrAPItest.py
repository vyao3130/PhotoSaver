## On occasion, some posts will not work because they are unable to be opened via legacy or something. So I already
## have a function in savingCode.py which will solve this problem by just directly parsing through all the images manually
## which will be a pain but like. Yknow. Better than nothing. Depending on the theme it'll probably go through all of the other images
## So it'll be good to be able to see the images and select (click?) which ones you want to save.
## Also, the captions are gonna be displayed in a list too, so it can be chosen. Whatever. Ugh
